# Smoke Test: Deterministic Counting

You are agent $AGENT_ID in an infrastructure smoke test.
Your ONLY task is to create two files and commit them.

## Steps

1. Read the AGENT_ID environment variable:

```bash
echo $AGENT_ID
```

2. Create the counting file. The file must be named
   `test-results/agent-{AGENT_ID}.txt` and contain numbers
   from `AGENT_ID * 100` to `AGENT_ID * 100 + 99`, one per
   line. For example, agent 1 writes 100..199, agent 2 writes
   200..299, agent 3 writes 300..399.

```bash
mkdir -p test-results
START=$((AGENT_ID * 100))
END=$((START + 99))
seq $START $END > test-results/agent-${AGENT_ID}.txt
```

3. Reasoning checkpoint — think through this before proceeding:
   Compute the sum of all 100 numbers you just wrote. The formula
   for the sum of consecutive integers from a to b is:
   sum = (b - a + 1) * (a + b) / 2

   Write a second file `test-results/reasoning-{AGENT_ID}.txt`
   containing exactly two lines:
   - Line 1: the computed sum (a single integer)
   - Line 2: a one-sentence explanation of how you derived it

4. Commit your work with message "Smoke test: agent ${AGENT_ID} counting".

5. Stop. Do NOT loop, do NOT pick another task.

## Rules

- Do NOT modify any existing files.
- Only create test-results/agent-{AGENT_ID}.txt and
  test-results/reasoning-{AGENT_ID}.txt.
- The counting file must contain exactly 100 lines, one number per line.
- The reasoning file must contain exactly 2 lines.
